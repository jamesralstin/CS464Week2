Hello, James Ralstin here.

I am updating this readme file as part of assignment requirements for Oregon State Universities CS464 - Introduction to Open Source Software course.

I am a 30 year old Post-Bacclaureate student, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, having already completed Bachelor of Science's in Manufacturing Engineering and Industrial Engineering in 2011 and 2013 respectively. Both of my aforementioned degrees were completed throgh Oregon State Universities School of Manufacturing, Industrial, and Mechanical Engineering.

This is just a little bit about me. I hope you have enjoyed reading this.
